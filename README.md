## Overview

Culinaid is a mobile web application that recommends recipes real-time as the user adds items to the cart, displayed along with information such as recipe match percentage and location of the items for each recipe in the current store. This provides users with recipes they could prepare with current cart items and the location of items they could buy to complete the required ingredient list. Our application provides the interface of an imaginary retail company with multiple stores, utilizing multiple NCR APIs including Order, Catalog, Sites, Security & Provisioning and a custom Recipe API.

## Problem 

The problem we attempt to address with this project is that people don't always have a clear idea of what meals they can prepare while shopping for ingredients. Oftentimes, people will get to a store and search up recipes on the spot and have to figure out where the items are at the store. Additionally, customers aren't usually aware of whether a recipe fits their dietary restrictions.

## Solution

We built a system where items in the store can be scanned using your phone. As the items are being added into the cart, our recommendation system would start providing recipe recommendations based off the items in the cart as well as the user's transaction history and the store items' popularity, along with the location of the items for each recipe in the store. This system would help in providing consumers with suitable recipes, making their decision-making process a lot easier.

## Value

Our project offers a lot to the customers in that with quality recommendations, stores gain valuable customers. A good recommendation system can increase the store's conversion ratio by 30% [1]. Also, with just 5% retention, profits can be boosted by 25% to 95% [2]. 
This project can be integrated with Freshop Mobile Shopper, adding further value to an existing NCR product. Our solution would differentiate NCR from our competitors as there is nothing similar in the market currently.
